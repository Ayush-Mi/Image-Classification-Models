# Image-Classification-Models
Image classification is one of the basic tasks of computer vision based applications. This repository contains implementaion code of binary as well as multi class classification of image using convolutional networks and pre-trained image models.
#Datasets
The dataset used for binary classification has been taken from:[Surface Crack Detection] (https://www.kaggle.com/arunrk7/surface-crack-detectionwhich) contains images of concrete walls with and without cracks in it.
For Multiclass classification I have used [Placeholder]()

##The code is in python and requires following libraries:
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Numpy
